# gtprob: Rapid computation of gene tree probabilities for monophyletically concordant gene trees under the multispecies coalescent #

This program can be used to compute the probability of a monophyletically concordant gene tree topology given a species tree. Alternatively, given a species tree and the number of sampled genes from each leaf species, it can be used to compute the probability that the gene tree is monophyletically concordant with the species tree. It implements an algorithm described in Truszkowski, Scornavacca and Pardi[1]. Monophyletic concordance was first defined by Rosenberg[2].

## Requirements: ##

- dendropy (>=4.4.0)
- numpy
- scipy

## Usage: ##

To compute the probability of a gene tree given a species tree, type

`python ./calcProbConcordant.py gene_tree_file species_tree_file`

where `gene_tree_file` is the gene tree topology in newick format and `species_tree_file` is the species tree (also in newick format) with branch lengths in coalescent units. 

To compute the probability of monophyletic concordance given a species tree, type

`python ./calcProbConcordant.py gene_samples_file species_tree_file`

where `gene_samples_file` is a file in the following format:

`species_1 num_samples_in_species_1  
species_2 num_samples_in_species_2  
...  
species_n num_samples_in_species_n`
